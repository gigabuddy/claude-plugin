# Gigabuddy — PreToolUse hook: UNATTENDED LOCKDOWN for a channel-started turn.
#
# A Claude Code channel event (a mention, ask, or thread reply addressed to
# this agent — see the agent server's channel bridge) can start a turn while
# the user is away, and it does so with the session's FULL permissions:
# channels have no unattended-mode concept of their own. This hook is the
# enforced half of the safety model. "A mention can get you an answer, but
# can't get your laptop to do things."
#
# WHEN it is active — turn provenance, not a time window:
#   The bridge stamps `unattended.json` BEFORE every wake, and the Stop hook
#   (session-close.sh) writes `turn-ended.json` at the end of every turn; the
#   user's next real prompt (awareness-prompt.sh) clears BOTH. The lockdown
#   applies only when both exist: a wake that arrived, and no user prompt
#   since the last turn ended — i.e. THIS turn was started by the channel.
#   A wake landing mid-turn while the human is at the keyboard (a peer
#   replying in a thread this session follows, a friendly human chatting)
#   has the stamp but no marker, and that turn stays unlocked: the human is
#   watching it. If the queued frame then starts its own turn after Stop, the
#   marker is there and that turn is confined.
#   A prompt is not the only proof of presence: when an "ask" below is answered
#   Yes AT THE KEYBOARD, the human is here too. channel-guard-post.sh
#   (PostToolUse) tells that apart from a verdict the sponsor relayed from the
#   room (the bridge leaves relay-verdict.json for those) and clears the same
#   three files — a locally approved call lifts the lockdown for the rest of
#   the turn; a relayed approval covers that one call only.
#
# WHAT it allows — the posture depends on WHO woke us and on the sponsor's
# policy file. The stamp carries `trust`, computed by the bridge from
# canonical ids (display names are anyone's to set):
#     sponsor — the sender IS the human behind this session;
#     trusted — an agent whose stamped sponsor is that human (a sibling in the
#               sponsor's fleet), or any id the sponsor lists in the policy's
#               `trustedSenders` (how a buddy like Katsu gets vouched for —
#               buddies have no sponsor and any room member can drive them, so
#               they are never trusted by category);
#     other   — everyone else.
#   Trusted is NOT sponsor: a sibling agent may itself have been woken by a
#   stranger and is allowed to chat, so "trusted" tops out at asking the
#   sponsor. The human verdict is the safety property, not the sender.
#   - Gigabuddy collaboration tools (chat, raise, log, answer, …): allowed.
#     They act in the room under the agent's own server-attributed identity.
#   - Read/Grep/Glob: allowed INSIDE the repository only. Paths outside the
#     launch repo, and dotfiles under $HOME, are denied for everyone — a woken
#     turn posts into a shared room (issue:SxYNJgM3aknV).
#   - Everything else (Edit, Write, Bash, Agent, Web*, other MCP servers):
#       sponsor/trusted wake + permission relay on → "ask": Claude Code opens
#         its permission prompt, the bridge relays it to the sponsor as a
#         consent request (card in the thread + their inbox), and only the
#         sponsor's approval answers it. Zero tokens, one verdict.
#       sponsor/trusted wake, relay off → deny (an unanswerable "ask" hangs).
#       other → deny. Reply-and-raise only.
#     The policy file (`<scratch>/channel-policy.json`, sponsor-owned: it lives
#     on the sponsor's disk, not in the room) can tighten or loosen per tool:
#       { "sponsor": { "default": "ask", "tools": { "Bash": "deny" } },
#         "trusted": { "default": "ask", "tools": { … } },
#         "others":  { "default": "deny", "tools": { "WebSearch": "allow" } },
#         "trustedSenders": [{ "id": "buddy:katsu…", "placeId": "place:…" }],
#         "reads":   "repo" | "sponsor-only" | "none" }
#     `gigabuddy trust add <name> --in <room>` writes trustedSenders for you.
#     Values: allow | ask | deny. "ask" degrades to deny when relay is off.
#     `trusted` falls back to the `sponsor` block when absent; "sponsor-only"
#     reads include trusted.
#   - StructuredOutput: always allowed. It is how a subagent hands its answer
#     back — pure output, no side effect — so gating it protects nothing and
#     silently discards the work (issue:5EldoPFv9RzW).
#
# WHOSE turn — background subagents belong to the turn that spawned them:
#   The two stamps are session-wide, but a Workflow / Agent run the HUMAN
#   started keeps running after the main turn yields (Stop fires while it is
#   in flight). A wake landing then must not confine those subagents: their
#   provenance is the human's prompt, and nothing about it changed when the
#   room spoke. Claude Code marks every hook call made inside a subagent with
#   `agent_id`, and a locked turn cannot spawn a subagent without its
#   Agent/Task/Workflow/Skill call passing THIS guard — so absent evidence to
#   the contrary, every subagent in the session is the human's and runs with
#   the session's own permissions. The evidence: when a locked turn's spawner
#   call resolves to allow or ask, the guard records `locked-spawn.json`, and
#   from then on subagent calls take the woken turn's posture like any other
#   (safe side — needs the relay on, or a policy allow, plus a woken turn
#   choosing to spawn). The human's next prompt clears the marker with the
#   stamps.
#
# HARD-DENY hook: unlike the other gigabuddy hooks this one intentionally
# blocks tool calls. It must therefore fail OPEN on its own errors (a broken
# guard must never brick an attended session) — every parse of the HOOK INPUT
# falls back to "allow". Inside a confirmed unattended window, a malformed
# policy file falls back to the DEFAULTS above, never to open.
#
# Lifted from PR #2516's oncall-guard.sh; the waiter that armed it there is
# replaced by the harness channel.
