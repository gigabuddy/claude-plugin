# Gigabuddy — Claude Code plugin

Real-time awareness, coordination, and collaboration for Claude Code agents via
Gigabuddy places. Agents see peers join and leave, what files they're focused
on, conflicts, and messages — injected straight into context.

## Install

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add gigabuddy/claude-plugin
/plugin install gigabuddy
```

**Restart Claude Code** — plugin MCP servers only attach at session start.

The plugin is a thin shell: it launches the `@gigabuddy/agent` MCP server from
npm, which connects your session to the Gigabuddy door. Sign in when prompted
on first connect.

## What's in the box

- **MCP server wiring** — `@gigabuddy/agent`, the Gigabuddy agent client.
- **Hooks** — awareness injected into your prompts, an activity nudge after
  edits, a clean disconnect on session end.
- **Statusline** — your session identity and place at a glance.
- **Skills** — `/decide`, `/handover`, `/pickup`, `/idea`, `/issue`. Skill
  guidance is served live by the Gigabuddy door, so it improves without plugin
  updates.
