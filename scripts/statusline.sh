# Gigabuddy — Status line reader (forkless).
#
# The heavy lifting moved into the MCP server (statuslineRenderer.ts), which
# renders `.gigabuddy/sessions/cc_<sessionId>/statusline.txt` event-driven — on inbox
# changes, transcript appends, HEAD flips, host-pressure changes. This script
# is a pure-bash reader: it parses the session id off stdin, reads that file,
# and formats the two time-varying bits (idle clock, office-hours countdown)
# with shell builtins. It spawns ZERO child processes — the old script forked
# ~20 (jq/git/awk/stat/…) per refresh per session, which at a dozen sessions
# was most of a dev container's idle CPU.
#
# File format (v1, written atomically by the renderer):
#   v1 <aliveEpoch> <lastTurnEpoch|0> <coldSecs> <ohUntilEpoch|0>
#   <line1 — live status, with {{IDLE}} and optional {{OHMIN}} placeholders>
#   <line2 — location context; may be empty>
#
# Claude pipes the session JSON on stdin.

# Epoch clock. %(...)T is a printf builtin (bash ≥4.2) — the forkless clock.
# Stock macOS bash is 3.2 and doesn't have it; fall back to ONE `date` fork per

# the forkless design exists for container hosts running dozens, and those have
# a modern bash.

# refresh, a write only when the value first appears or changes. Still no forks.
